Flight Management System

This project implements a simple Flight Management System using File Handling techniques in C programming language.

Access Levels
The system supports two access levels:

Admin Access: Password-protected access for administrators.
User Access: Access for regular users.


Admin Access
    
    In the admin access mode, administrators have the following privileges:

        Insert new flights into the system.
        Display the flights.
        Delete flight records.
        Modify flight schedules.
        Display the list of registered users.
        View the list of passengers who have booked flights.

User Access
    In the user access mode, users can perform the following actions:

    Book available tickets for flights.
    Cancel booked tickets.
    Add balance to their accounts.
    Check the status of their booked flights.

Function Consistency

Throughout the development of this script, special attention has been given to ensuring consistency in the implementation of functions. This includes:

    Handling of all possible loopholes and edge cases in each function.
    Logical deduction of money in all relevant functions to maintain consistency
